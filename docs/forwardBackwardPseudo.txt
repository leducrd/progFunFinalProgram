PROBLEM STATEMENT---

In the board game program, after the player rolls the die, instead of prompts
asking for forward or backward, two buttons should appear, one that says forward
and one that says backward. When the user clicks the “forward” button, the roll
result is added to their position. When the player clicks the backward button,
the roll result is subtracted from the player’s positon. The buttons disappear
once the player has made their decision, and reappear when they have rolled the
die again.

Nouns: roll result, forward and backward button, player position

Verbs: roll die, appear, click forward, click backward, disappear


DEFINING DIAGRAM---

INPUTS:
  rollResult
  forwardButton
  backwardButton

PROCESSING:
  Roll die
  Output rollResult
  Forward button
    Add to player position
  Backward button
    Subtract player position
  Output player positon

OUTPUTS
  Player moves forward
  Player moves backward

PSEUDOCODE---

moveForward with playerPosition, dieResult, winPosition
  playerPosition = playerPosition + dieResult

  if playerPosition > winPosition
    playerPosition = winPosition

  return playerPosition
END

moveBackward with playerPosition, dieResult, winPosition
  playerPosition = playerPosition - dieResult

  if playerPosition < 0
    playerPosition = 0
END

calculatePlayerPosition with playerPosition, dieResult, winPosition

  forwardButton.event listener "submit" function(decisionForward)
    CALL moveForward function
  ENDLISTENER

  backwardButton.even listener "submit" function(moveBackward)
    CALL moveBackward function
  ENDLISTENER

END

Main

  IF player1Turn
    player1Position = calculatePlayerPosition
  ELSE
    player2Position = calculatePlayerPosition

TEST PLANS

Variables: click backward, click forward

TEST PLAN 1:

  INPUT: click forward

  EXPECTED: Adds result number to playerPosition, resulting in playerPosition
            being a higher number

  ACTUAL:

TEST PLAN 2:

  INPUT: click backward

  EXPECTED: Subtracts resultNumber from playerPosition, resulting in playerPosition
            being a higher number

  ACTUAL:
